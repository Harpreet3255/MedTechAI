MedFlowAI: Real-Time Patient Flow & Bed Allocation Optimizer
MedFlowAI is an AI-powered platform that intelligently manages patient flow within hospitals by optimizing bed assignment, diagnostic test prioritization, and internal routing — all in real-time. The system integrates clinical data, EHR notes, and operational capacity to significantly reduce wait times and improve care delivery.

🚑 Imagine a Google Maps for patients inside the hospital — routing them through diagnostics, beds, and wards based on urgency, resources, and predictions.

🏥 Problem Statement
Hospitals face critical delays due to inefficient resource allocation:

Patients wait for hours due to manual or outdated bed management systems.
Diagnostics (CT, MRI, labs) often have long queues without urgency-based triaging.
Intra-hospital routing decisions are non-optimized and reactive.
💡 AI-Powered Solution
MedFlowAI provides:

🛏 Dynamic Bed Allocation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
🧬 Urgency Prediction from Clinical Notes using NLP (BERT fine-tuned on MIMIC-IV)
📈 Forecasts of Diagnostic Queue Times using XGBoost and Temporal Models
🧠 Intra-Hospital Routing Assistant that adapts in real time to hospital conditions
